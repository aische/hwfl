# Session handoff

Run this at the end of a coding session or when the user asks to save progress.

## Steps

1. **Review what changed**
   - Scan git diff and recent commits (if any)
   - Identify decisions made, blockers resolved, and tasks completed

2. **Update `docs/STATUS.md`**
   - Set "Last updated" to today's date
   - Rewrite "Current focus", "Done recently", "Blockers", "Next up"
   - Keep the file under 80 lines

3. **Update `docs/TASKS.md`**
   - Check off completed items in **Now**
   - Promote items from **Next** to **Now** if appropriate
   - Move long **Done** lists to `docs/log/archive/tasks-YYYY-MM.md`

4. **Log decisions (optional)**
   - Append to `docs/log/YYYY-MM.md` only for design decisions, blocker
     resolutions, or milestones
   - Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title` then bullet points

5. **Summarize for the user**
   - 3–5 bullets: what was done, what's next, any open blockers

## Do not

- Copy chat prompts into the log
- List every file changed (git covers that)
- Grow `TASKS.md` with archived completed work
- Propose reinventing hwfi's step DSL
